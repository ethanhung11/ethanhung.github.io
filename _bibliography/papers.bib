	abstract = {Tensor factorization is a dimensionality reduction method applied to multidimensional arrays. These methods are useful for identifying patterns within a variety of biomedical datasets due to their ability to preserve the organizational structure of experiments and therefore aid in generating meaningful insights. However, missing data in the datasets being analyzed can impose challenges. Tensor factorization can be performed with some level of missing data and reconstruct a complete tensor. However, while tensor methods may impute these missing values, the choice of fitting algorithm may influence the fidelity of these imputations. Previous approaches, based on alternating least squares with prefilled values or direct optimization, suffer from introduced bias or slow computational performance. In this study, we propose that censored least squares can better handle missing values with data structured in tensor form. We ran censored least squares on four different biological datasets and compared its performance against alternating least squares with prefilled values and direct optimization. We used the error of imputation and the ability to infer masked values to benchmark their missing data performance. Censored least squares appeared best suited for the analysis of high-dimensional biological data by accuracy and convergence metrics across several studies.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Cytokines operate in concert to maintain immune homeostasis and coordinate immune responses. In cases of ER+ breast cancer, peripheral immune cells exhibit altered responses to several cytokines, and these alterations are correlated strongly with patient outcomes. To develop a systems-level understanding of this dysregulation, we measured a panel of cytokine responses and receptor abundances in the peripheral blood of healthy controls and ER+ breast cancer patients across immune cell types. Using tensor factorization to model this multidimensional data, we found that breast cancer patients exhibited widespread alterations in response, including drastically reduced response to IL-10 and heightened basal levels of pSmad2/3 and pSTAT4. ER+ patients also featured upregulation of PD-L1, IL6Rα, and IL2Rα, among other receptors. Despite this, alterations in response to cytokines were not explained by changes in receptor abundances. Thus, tensor factorization helped to reveal a coordinated reprogramming of the immune system that was consistent across our cohort.},
